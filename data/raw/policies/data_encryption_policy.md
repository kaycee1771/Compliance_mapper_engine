## Purpose
To protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data through encryption.

## Scope
Covers all systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive data.

## Policy
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2+) must be used.
- Encryption keys must be stored in a secure Key Management System (KMS).
- Key rotation must occur at least every 12 months.
- Public key infrastructure (PKI) must be used for authentication and signing.

## Enforcement
